1. Use interpolator_func.py for generating the ssh data. Please refer to example.ipynb for the usage of interpolator class.
2. Use generate_segmentation_mask.py for generating the segmentation masks using py-eddytracking for ssh data that were generated by interpolator class
3. Use cnn_training.py for generating the trained weights
4. Finally use cnn_testing.py for generating the predicted segmentation mask data using the trained weights.
## Please correct the time, latitiude and logitude boundries according your data as they are hard-coded in the script.
## Refer to following pipeline if there is some confusion.
